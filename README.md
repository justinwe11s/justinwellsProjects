# justinwellsProjects
My name is Gregory Justin Wells. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park who enjoys making video games. I plan to go into cloud computing and video game development after graduation.
This is my first repository, and here I'll just be putting all of the code from personal projects and school here.
